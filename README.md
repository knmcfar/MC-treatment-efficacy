# Efficacy of Mucosal Candidiasis Treatments on HIV-Positive Women

A individual report was created for the BIOST 540: Longitudinal and Multilevel Data Analysis final. This report examines the efficacy of two treatments that are intended to prevent mucosal candidiasis in HIV+ women over a year-long period using a generalized linear mixed model.

# Contents

The report, code, and dataset (the csv file entitled mucosal_candidiasis_data) are uploaded to this repository. If the dataset is saved to the same directory that the working directory is set to, the dataset can be imported to R directly using the code.

# Lessons Learned

This project allowed me to gain some experience with a well-known longitudinal model with a binary outcome and with investigating the amount of missingness in longitudinal data. I was also able to employ methods for imputation and conduct sensitivity analyses using best-case and worst-case scenarios for missing data.
